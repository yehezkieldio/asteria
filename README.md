<h3>Asteria</h3>
<p>Remote input relay system to control Windows from Linux peripherals over the network.</p>

</div>

Asteria is a cross-platform, client-server input relay system, designed to let me control a Windows machine using the keyboard and mouse connected to a Linux host. It captures raw input events from Linux, streams them over a low-latency TCP, and simulates them on the target Windows machine with high precision and minimal delay.
